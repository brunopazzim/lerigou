## Installation

Don't keep it in and add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lerigou'

Conceal, don't feel, and then execute:

    $ bundle

If you want to test your limits you can also install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lerigou

## Usage

It's funny how some instructions makes everything feel so easy:

No right, no wrong, add this to your application.js:
```javascript
//= require snowstorm
```
Then all you need to Let It Go is to add this to your page:
```html
<script src="snowstorm.js"></script>
```
And you're done! Now that that the storm is raging on, never go back to your old and warm website! Remember: the cold never bothered us anyway.
